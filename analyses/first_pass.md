# FIRST PASS ANALYSIS #

## PLAN ##

Data Summary:
  * 193 samples with non-missing phenotypes, covariates, and SM_IDs. (need to check where ID encoding issues exist when merging phenotype, covariate, and genotype data frames.)
  * 8733 SNPs.

Single SNP tests:


Issues:
  * Mismatched sample IDs between covariate file [Covariates_Vasa_newIDs.csv] and phenotype file [ANC_Nadir_vasyaModified.csv].
  * Missing sample IDs in consensus VCF file.
